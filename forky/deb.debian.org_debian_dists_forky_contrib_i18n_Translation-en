Package: dynare-matlab
Description-md5: 90e8fcabb135fcf60e09f0be51774946
Description-en: MATLAB support for Dynare
 Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models, in
 particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and overlapping
 generations (OLG) models. The models solved by Dynare include those relying on
 the rational expectations hypothesis, wherein agents form their expectations
 about the future in a way consistent with the model. But Dynare is also able
 to handle models where expectations are formed differently: on one extreme,
 models where agents perfectly anticipate the future; on the other extreme,
 models where agents have limited rationality or imperfect knowledge of the
 state of the economy and, hence, form their expectations through a learning
 process. In terms of types of agents, models solved by Dynare can incorporate
 consumers, productive firms, governments, monetary authorities, investors and
 financial intermediaries. Some degree of heterogeneity can be achieved by
 including several distinct classes of agents in each of the aforementioned
 agent categories.
 .
 Dynare offers a user-friendly and intuitive way of describing these models. It
 is able to perform simulations of the model given a calibration of the model
 parameters and is also able to estimate these parameters given a dataset. In
 practice, the user will write a text file containing the list of model
 variables, the dynamic equations linking these variables together, the
 computing tasks to be performed and the desired graphical or numerical
 outputs.
 .
 This package is only useful to users having MATLAB installed on their
 machine. It contains the source of the MEX files and will recompile them using
 the existing MATLAB installation.

 by the discovery of subspace which makes interstellar travel not
 only possible but also fast and easy. As a result the Terrans have
 expanded their territory, eventually encountering another bipedal,
 sentient species; the Vasudans. However, due to cultural differences
 and difficulties in communicating with each other, the Galactic Terran

Package: libdemeter-perl
Description-md5: 61bcaabdcd578f132064042eed689bdf
Description-en: comprehensive XAS data analysis system using Feff and Ifeffit or Larch
 Demeter provides an object oriented interface to the EXAFS data analysis
 capabilities of the popular and powerful Ifeffit package and its successor
 Larch. Given that the Ifeffit and Larch APIs involve streams of text
 commands, this package is, at heart, a code generator. Many methods of this
 package return text. All actual interaction with Ifeffit or Larch is handled
 through a single method, dispose, which is described below. The internal
 structure of this package involves accumulating text in a scalar variable
 through successive calls to the various code generating methods. This text is
 then disposed to Ifeffit, to Larch, to a file, or elsewhere. The outward
 looking methods organize all of the complicated interactions of your data
 with Ifeffit or Larch.
 .
 This package is aimed at many targets. It can be the back-end of a graphical
 data analysis program, providing the glue between the on-screen
 representation of the fit and the actual command executed by Ifeffit or
 Larch. It can be used for one-off data analysis chores -- indeed most of the
 examples that come with the package can be reworked into useful one-off
 scripts. It can also be the back-end to sophisticated data analysis chores
 such as high-throughout data processing and analysis or complex physical
 modeling.

 .
 While there are two entry points to the graph API (i.e. backend and frontend),
 we expect that most users will use the frontend entry point because:
 .
 It is less verbose without loss of control. All functionality accessible
 through the backend API is also accessible through the frontend API.  It adds
 functionality on top of the backend API, like errata filters and autotuning.

Package: libcutlass-dev
Description-md5: 4d44009005870b8473610afb57050108
Description-en: CUDA Templates for Linear Algebra Subroutines
 CUTLASS is a collection of CUDA C++ template abstractions for implementing
 high-performance matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) and related computations
 at all levels and scales within CUDA. It incorporates strategies for
 hierarchical decomposition and data movement similar to those used to implement
 cuBLAS and cuDNN. CUTLASS decomposes these "moving parts" into reusable,
 modular software components abstracted by C++ template classes. Primitives for
 different levels of a conceptual parallelization hierarchy can be specialized
 and tuned via custom tiling sizes, data types, and other algorithmic policy.
 The resulting flexibility simplifies their use as building blocks within custom
 kernels and applications.
 .
 To support a wide variety of applications, CUTLASS provides extensive support
 for mixed-precision computations, providing specialized data-movement and
 multiply-accumulate abstractions for half-precision floating point (FP16),
 BFloat16 (BF16), Tensor Float 32 (TF32), single-precision floating point
 (FP32), FP32 emulation via tensor core instruction, double-precision
 floating point (FP64) types, integer data types (4b and 8b), and binary
 data types (1b). CUTLASS demonstrates warp-synchronous matrix multiply
 operations targeting the programmable, high-throughput Tensor Cores
 implemented by NVIDIA's Volta, Turing, Ampere, and Hopper architectures.

 OpenRCT2 is an open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2
 (RCT2). The gameplay revolves around building and maintaining an
 amusement park containing attractions, shops and facilities. The player
 must try to make a profit and maintain a good park reputation whilst
 keeping the guests happy. OpenRCT2 allows for both scenario and sandbox
 play. Scenarios require the player to complete a certain objective in a
 set time limit whilst sandbox allows the player to build a more flexible
 park with optionally no restrictions or finance.
 .
 RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 was originally written by Chris Sawyer in x86
 assembly and is the sequel to RollerCoaster Tycoon. The engine was based
 on Transport Tycoon, an older game which also has an equivalent
 open-source project, OpenTTD. OpenRCT2 attempts to provide everything
 from RCT2 as well as many improvements and additional features, some of
 these include support for modern platforms, an improved interface,
 improved guest and staff AI, more editing tools, increased limits, and
 cooperative multiplayer. It also re-introduces mechanics from RollerCoaster
 Tycoon that were not present in RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Some of those

Package: repo
Description-md5: 1496a967d4bcbc0d6ebc3348869abf22
Description-en: repository management tool built on top of git
 Repo is a repository management tool that the Android developers built on top
 of Git. Repo unifies the many Git repositories when necessary, does the
 uploads to the Android revision control system, and automates parts of the
 Android development workflow. Repo is not meant to replace Git, only to make
 it easier to work with Git in the context of Android. The repo command is an
 executable Python script that you can put anywhere in your path. In working
 with the Android source files, you will use Repo for across-network
 operations. For example, with a single Repo command you can download files
 from multiple repositories into your local working directory.
 .
 repo is an unusual tool because it downloads all of its own Python modules
 using GPG-signed git tags, and stores those files as part of the project that
 it is working with.  So this package just provides the wrapper script, which
 provides the GPG signing keys for verifying that the correct Python code was
 downloaded.

Description-en: Simple and powerful network transmission of ZFS snapshots
 simplesnap is a simple way to send ZFS snapshots across a net‐
 work. Although it can serve many purposes, its primary goal is
 to manage backups from one ZFS filesystem to a backup filesystem
 also running ZFS, using incremental backups to minimize network
 traffic and disk usage.
 .
 simplesnap it is designed to perfectly compliment
 snapshotting tools, permitting rotating backups with arbitrary
 retention periods. It lets multiple machines back up a single
 target, lets one machine back up multiple targets, and keeps it
 all straight.
 .
 simplesnap is easy; there is no configuration file needed. One
 ZFS property is available to exclude datasets/filesystems. ZFS
 datasets are automatically discovered on machines being backed
 up.
 .
 simplesnap  is robust in the face of interrupted
 transfers, and needs little help to keep running.
 .
 Unlike many similar tools, simplesnap does not
 require full root access to the machines being backed up. It
 runs only a small wrapper as root, and the wrapper has only three
 commands it implements.

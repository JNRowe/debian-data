 Angband is a single-player, text-based, dungeon simulation derived
 from the game Moria, which was in turn based on Rogue. It is
 often described as a "roguelike" game because the look and feel of
 the game is still quite similar to Rogue (though there are now graphical
 tiles available if you dislike ASCII gaming). Angband has been in more or
 less continuous development since the early 1990s.

Description-en: client to donate unused CPU cycles to distributed.net
 Donate your extra CPU cycles to a worthy cause!
 .
 distributed.net started in 1997 as a project whose purpose was to win a
 series of contests sponsored by RSA Data Security Inc., to crack their RC5
 encryption by brute-force methods. These contests were meant to show
 governments of nations such as the United States, who limit exports or
 use of cryptography, that the standards allowed are too weak for general
 use.
 .
 Since this time, distributed.net's focus has changed from solely
 cracking RSA's RC5 and DES projects to working on more diverse
 distributed computing problems.
 .
 The ongoing projects are RC5-72 and Optimal Golomb Rulers (28-mark), the
 latter of which has practical applications in science. There are also a
 number of other projects which are either periodic or upcoming. You may
 choose which project you wish to participate in.
 .
 Installing this package will allow unused CPU cycles on your computer to
 contribute to cracking the code. There should be no noticeable slowdown of
 your system, since the client runs niced, and only uses CPU time when
 your computer would otherwise be idle.

 Google's Android SDK Platform-Tools is a component for the Android SDK. It
 includes tools that interface with the Android platform, such as adb,
 fastboot, and systrace. These tools are required for Android app development.
 They're also needed if you want to unlock your device bootloader and flash
 it with a new system image.
 .
 Although some new features in these tools are available only for recent
 versions of Android, the tools are backward compatible, so you need only
 one version of the SDK Platform-Tools.

 otherwise, these docs have to phone home in order for any of the javascript
 to work.

Description-md5: 2227b7676c8238af395d98e3c4d3e103
Description-en: mkfs and fsck for HFS and HFS+ file systems
 The HFS+ file system used by Apple Computer for their Mac OS is
 supported by the Linux kernel.  Apple provides mkfs and fsck for
 HFS+ with the Unix core of their operating system, Darwin.
 .
 This package is a port of Apple's tools for HFS+ filesystems.
 .
 For users, HFS+ seems to be a good compromise to carry files between
 MacOS X and Linux Machines, as HFS+ doesn't suffer the problems of
 FAT32 like:
 .
  * huge space waste (in slack space as devices grow faster);
  * ability to create files that are more than 4GB in size (especially
    good for those working with multimedia and that need to carry large
    ISO files);
  * ability to use case preserving (and even sensitivity!);
  * ability to use uid's and gid's on the filesystem.
 .
 Users in general can enjoy such benefits since it is expected to have
 more HFS+ filesystems in use, as Apple has announced Macintoshes for
 ix86-64, besides the filesystem being already supported by PowerPC
 systems since the beginning.

Description-en: ICC color profiles for use with color profile aware software
 Color management allows controlled conversion between color representation of
 input and output devices and color spaces. ICC profiles are an important part
 of color management. They are data files that represent mappings between the
 input or output color space of a particular device and the device-agnostic
 profile connection space (PCS) in accordance with the standards set by the
 International Color Consortium (ICC). This package contains a number of high
 quality ICC color profiles for use with color profile aware software such as
 Scribus, Gimp, CinePaint, Krita, or Digikam. In general this package is
 useful if the software using it was built against a color management support
 library such as liblcms1 or liblcms2-2. In some software such as Scribus you
 have to explicitly enable color managemenent in the preferences to be able to
 use these profiles.

 flexible synthesis of expressive speech.
 .
 The main feature of DE6 is therefore that it contains a complete diphone
 set for three different voice qualities defined by their vocal effort, low
 effort ("soft voice"), medium effort ("normal or modal voice"), and high
 effort ("loud voice").
 .
 This diphone database was recorded jointly by the Institute of Phonetics at
 Saarland University and by the Language Technology Department at DFKI,
 Saarbrücken.

 SiSU is a lightweight markup based, command line oriented, document
 structuring, publishing and search framework for document collections.
 .
 With minimal preparation of a plain-text, (UTF-8) file, using its native
 markup syntax in your text editor of choice, SiSU can generate various
 document formats (most of which share a common object numbering system for
 locating content), including plain text, HTML, XHTML, XML, EPUB, OpenDocument
 text (ODF:ODT), LaTeX, PDF files, and populate an SQL database with objects
 (roughly paragraph-sized chunks) so searches may be performed and matches
 returned with that degree of granularity: your search criteria is met by these
 documents and at these locations within each document. Object numbering is
 particularly suitable for "published" works (finalized texts as opposed to
 works that are frequently changed or updated) for which it provides a fixed
 means of reference of content. Document outputs also share semantic meta-data
 provided.
 .
 SiSU also provides concordance files, document content certificates and
 manifests of generated output.
 .
 man pages, and interactive help are provided.
 .
 Dependencies for additional features are taken care of in sisu related
 packages.
 .
 The dummy package sisu-complete together with sisu-markup-samples installs

 and spectroscopy, which as part of their fundamental operation depend
 upon the extraction of a phase signal from their input image. Usually
 the phase is available in a form that suffers from 2-pi phase jumps
 due to the use of the mathematical arctangent function, which produces
 an inherently wrapped output. This wrapped phase is unusable until the
 phase discontinuities are removed.
 .
 SNAPHU is an implementation of the Statistical-cost, Network-flow
 Algorithm for Phase Unwrapping particularly suitable for SAR
 interferometry applications. This algorithm poses phase unwrapping as
 a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation problem, the
 objective of which is to compute the most likely unwrapped solution
 given the observable input data. Because the statistics relating the
 input data to the solution depend on the measured quantity, SNAPHU
 incorporates three built-in statistical models, for topography data,
 deformation data, and smooth generic data. The posed optimization
 problem is solved approximately with use of network-flow techniques.
 .
 As SNAPHU uses an iterative optimization procedure, its execution time
 depends on the difficulty of the interferogram. In single-tile mode
 the required memory is on the order of 100 MB per 1000000 pixels in
 the input interferogram.

Package: tome
Description-md5: 9efcf47839037501aa7357051f1287d3
Description-en: single-player text-based roguelike dungeon simulation game
 Tome, short for Troubles of Middle Earth, is a single-player,
 text-based, dungeon simulation derived from the game angband, which
 in turn is derived from the older game Moria, which was in turn based
 on Rogue. It is often described as a "roguelike" game because the
 look and feel of the game is still quite similar to Rogue.
 .
 In tome, the  player may choose from a number of races and classes
 when creating a character, and then "run" that character over a
 period of days, weeks, even months, attempting to win the game by
 defeating Morgoth, who lurks somewhere in  the depths of the dungeon.
 .
 The ultimate goal of the game is to develop a character strong enough
 to defeat Morgoth, who resides on dungeon level 100. Upon doing so,
 you will receive the exalted status of "winner" and your character may
 retire.
 .
 The first main difference from Angband a new player to ToME will need
 to be aware of is that it has implemented a skills based system where
 instead of the  adventurer automatically improving in their abilities
 as they become more experienced, they get 5 skill points to spend on
 their character's abilities and can therefore customise what type of
 character they play. See the skills help file for details
 .
 The second major difference is that the main dungeon from Angband has
 been split  into 4 "dungeons", each of which cover a different
 portion of the dungeon's  levels. Note that not all of the places are
 actually "dungeons" - some are caves, forests, etc.
 .
 The third main difference between Vanilla Angband and ToME is the
 difference  in character classes and races, as well as a very
 different  magic system. ToME also offers the player the ability to
 undertake a series of  quests. It is not required for any adventurer
 to undertake  the fixed  quests, but they can result in some nice
 rewards.
 .
 Morgoth was 'the Dark Enemy of Middle-Earth' during its First Age. He
 was banished by the Valar (offspring of Eru, "god" of J.R.R.
 Tolkien's world) at the end of the First Age and thus never appears
 in The Lord of the Rings, set during the Third Age. Sauron, who does
 figure into those tales, was the most powerful of his servants. Read
 Tolkien's 'The Silmarillion' for more on the legends of Middle-Earth.
 Angband is a reference to Morgoth's "prison of iron."

 trn is a threaded news reader with a long history, descended from Larry
 Wall's rn (part of the second generation of newsreaders).  It has a
 powerful full screen text mode user interface, where most actions are
 available at the press of a single key.  It is highly configurable.
 .
 This version of trn reads news from a news server via NNTP (the Network
 News Transfer Protocol).  You must have a news server available - large
 sites usually provide a site-wide server.
 .
 If you install a news server on your system (either containing just
 local newsgroups or with a partial or full USENET feed) you can
 configure trn to access it.  In this case you will also need to install
 an appropriate 'inews' package for local posting.
 .
 This is a separate package from trn because trn 4.0 has enough
 substantial changes in its default behaviour (for instance, the group
 selector is new in 4.0) that some users prefer to stay with an older
 version of trn.

 structures. It is developed and maintained by the group of Ivo Hofacker
 in Vienna.
 .
 RNA secondary structure prediction through energy minimization is the
 most used function in the package. It provides three kinds of dynamic
 programming algorithms for structure prediction:
  * the minimum free energy algorithm of (Zuker & Stiegler 1981) which
    yields a single optimal structure,
  * the partition function algorithm of (McCaskill 1990) which calculates
    base pair probabilities in the thermodynamic ensemble, and the
    suboptimal folding algorithm of (Wuchty et.al 1999) which generates
    all suboptimal structures within a given energy range of the optimal
    energy.
 .
 For secondary structure comparison, the package contains several
 measures of distance (dissimilarities) using either string alignment or
 tree-editing (Shapiro & Zhang 1990). Finally, is provided an algorithm
 to design sequences with a predefined structure (inverse folding).
 The RNAforester package is a tool for aligning RNA secondary structures
 and it's user interface integrates to those of the tools of the
 Vienna RNA package.
